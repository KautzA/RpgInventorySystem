# RpgInventorySystem
System for representing a inventory for RPGs. Written as an assignment for CSYE 6200.

# Installation
To run the program run application.main as a JavaFX program. 

# Testing
There are two types of tests used in this repository, JUnit tests, and manual tests implemented before we configured JUnit.

## JUnit Tests
Our JUnit tests can be run with JUnit 4. In eclipse this is done by selecting "Run As" -> "JUnit Test".

## Manual Tests
For tests implemented before we configured JUnit they are run as java applications.
